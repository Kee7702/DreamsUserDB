<div class="global-annoucement"><a class="global-post-label">Migrating Storage</a><a class="global-post-icon" style="opacity:0">storage</a><a class="global-post-details">Due to certain factors which make the current database harder to maintain, I am switching back to Google Drive. This means that all future audio data will be uploaded to Google Drive only. Due to the way the transition will occur, all existing data will remain accesible in the repository until the transition is entirely complete (the branch will be purged afterwards). Now, Google Drive does have some drawbacks (which is why I switched from Google Drive) but I believe those issues are far better than having to somehow locally store that same data, currently with limited storage space.</a></div>
