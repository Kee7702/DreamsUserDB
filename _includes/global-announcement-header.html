<div class="global-annoucement"><a class="global-post-label">Migrating Storage</a><a class="global-post-icon" style="opacity:0">storage</a><a class="global-post-details">Due to certain factors which make the current database harder to maintain, I am switching back to Google Drive. This means that all future audio data will be uploaded to Google Drive only. Now, Google Drive does have some drawbacks (which is why I switched from Google Drive) but I believe those issues are far better than having to somehow locally store that same data, currently with limited storage space. However, with this change all files will be of one format also to simplify the JSON database, I've decided to use .OGG as the new permanent format.</a></div>
