## Welcome to the Dreams User Database! Built by [Despicable_Kee](https://indreams.me/Despicable_Kee), this database of content is a list of requested audio imports for the PS4 game called [Dreams™](https://store.playstation.com/?resolve=UP9000-CUSA08010_00-DREAMS0000000000) by [Media Molecule](https://mediamolecule.com/).

### The old webpage is meant to capture frozen-in-time user statistics when people make an import request (and when it's fulfilled). It had stored information such as the imp and username of users at the time and client-sided calculations.

## But... Times have changed

### A rebuilt webpage is undergoing development, utilizing the markdown and layout functionality of Jekyll. This will allow for consistency without client-side webpage building, as well as providing accurate embeds on websites such as Discord and Twitter.
#### For now, information about the innerworkings of the old webpage are below.

## Data Endpoint
#### Going away soon™
