  <h3 style="font-size: 16px;margin-block: 0;">The Metadata Update</h3>
  <h4 style="font-size: 14px;margin-block: 0;font-weight: 100;">A big update to the audio database was pushed to Google Drive, resulting in a new audio format and an easy way to use the files with nearly any audio applications and the title will remain the same. The metadata included is: Album, Album Art, Title. The artist is set to Dreams Audio Imports for all tracks, and the direct folder will soon be available for download. There will also be a way to directly view the audio by album from my website.</h4>
