  <h3 style="font-size: 16px;margin-block: 0;">The Metadata Update</h3>
  <h4 style="font-size: 14px;margin-block: 0;font-weight: 100;">A big update to the audio database was pushed to Google Drive, resulting in a new audio format and an easy way to use the files with nearly any audio applications and the title will remain the same. The metadata included is: Album (the product the track is from), Album Art (from the product the track is from), Title (a simplified version of the filename removing references to the product the track is from, unless in Other Oddities). The artist is set to Dreams Audio Imports for all tracks, and the direct folder will soon be available for download after some workaround has been made.</h4>
