# Embed the database into a custom webpage!
#### A new embed domain is available [here](https://embed.dreams.kee7702.tk/) which will allow you to specify a import name to embed. The parameter is the exact same as the Import Player so with a url such as [this](https://embed.dreams.kee7702.tk/?name=Homebrew%20Channel%20Theme) you get the example below.
<iframe src="https://embed.dreams.kee7702.tk/?name=Homebrew%20Channel%20Theme&amp;css=a.global-post-label%7Bbackground:%23333!important%7D.plyr--audio%20.plyr__controls%7Bpadding:8px!important%7D.plyr--audio%7Bmargin-top:-36px!important%7D" style="border:none;width: calc(50% - 16px);aspect-ratio: 16/9;border-radius: 20px;padding: 8px;background: #333;"></iframe>
#### At this time this is all the embed script can do, but there are future planned implementations.
### Planned Parameters
#### CSS
An early version of this has been added, though right now it is totally bare and requires specific element ids or classes to edit.
Soon, a full list of variables will be added.
#### Player
Coming eventually, will allow you to pick between the thin ad full player, though for now it's forced to the full player
