# Embed the database into a custom webpage!
#### A new embed domain is available [here](https://embed.dreams.kee7702.tk/) which will allow you to specify a import name to embed. The parameter is the exact same as the Import Player so with a url such as [this](https://embed.dreams.kee7702.tk/?name=Homebrew%20Channel%20Theme) you get the example below.
<iframe src="https://embed.dreams.kee7702.tk/?name=Homebrew%20Channel%20Theme" style="border:none;width: 50%;aspect-ratio: 16/9;border-radius: 20px;padding: 5px;background: #222;border-color: #333;border-width: 5px;border-style: solid;"></iframe>
#### At this time this is all the embed script can do, but there are future planned implementations.
### Planned Parameters
#### CSS
Coming very soon, allows you to push custom css to the website to change colors and more, though we will give you a list of parameters to easily override.
#### Player
Coming eventually, will allow you to pick between the thin ad full player, though for now it's forced to the full player
