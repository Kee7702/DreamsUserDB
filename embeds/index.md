## Embed Documentation
# Embed the database into a custom webpage!
#### The ability to embed imports is available at `/embed` which will allow you to specify an exact import name to embed.
<style>iframe.userdbembed {margin-top:4px;border:none;width:calc(50% - 6px);aspect-ratio:16/9;box-shadow:black 0 3px 4px 0;border-radius:10px;display:inline-block}iframe.userdbembed:nth-child(even){margin-left:8px}</style>
<div>
  <iframe src="/embed?id=lbp2-move_main_2" class="userdbembed"></iframe>
  <iframe src="/embed?id=lbp3-pod" class="userdbembed"></iframe>
  <iframe src="/embed?id=lbp-pod" class="userdbembed"></iframe>
  <iframe src="/embed?id=homebrew-channel" class="userdbembed"></iframe>
  <iframe src="/embed?id=lbp2-lb2" class="userdbembed" style="resize:both;width:100%;max-width:100%;min-width:300px;height:120px;max-height:684px;min-height:72px;"></iframe></div>

## Parameters
#### ID
##### Required. The ID of an import is a string of text made based on the import name itself, sometimes abbreviated. IDs can also be decided by the creator, when this happens, the original id is lost and all existing links will no longer work.
#### CSS
##### An early version of this has been added, though right now it is totally bare and requires specific element ids or classes to edit.
##### Soon, a full list of variables will be added.
#### experiment_light
##### An option, true/false(default) to change the embed (and in connection the entire website) to an experimental light mode. This is currently done using inverting rather than changing colors, so custom colors set in CSS will be inverted.

## About legacy IDs
##### Now that ids are all namespaced, they will never be changed, however this also means that any old ids were made invalid. Old ids were generated using a combination of the import title, the creation id, the image hash, and a few more key elements. These were all thrown into an algorithm that generated a unique token that would for certain never show on any other import.
##### The issue of the old token system is very obvious when you consider that one of the elements required in generating the ID can change very easily, entirely breaking the id.
